How To Run
==========

This repo uses Docker Compose to orchestrate the app, PostgreSQL, and Seq for logs.

Docker Compose
--------------
Prereqs
- Docker Desktop running
- .NET SDK (to export HTTPS dev cert)

Steps
1) Export HTTPS dev cert: `pwsh -File ./docker/create-dev-cert.ps1`
2) Launch: `docker compose up --build`

URLs
- App (HTTP): http://localhost:8080
- App (HTTPS): https://localhost:8443
- Seq UI: http://localhost:8081
- Seq ingestion: http://localhost:5341
- Postgres: localhost:5432 (db=app, user=postgres, pwd=postgres)
- Redis: localhost:6379
- Redis UI: http://localhost:5540 - Go to Add Redis Database and write redis://redis:6379

Notes
- App reads `appsettings.Docker.json` in `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Docker` (set by compose).
- Serilog sinks: Console + Seq (to `http://seq:5341` inside the compose network).
- Caching: HybridCache is enabled; Redis is required in Docker. TTLs can be tuned via `Cache:Movies:*`.

Redis specifics (Docker Compose)
- No local install needed: compose runs a `redis` service exposed on `6379`.
- The server is configured to use `redis:6379` inside the compose network via `appsettings.Docker.json` (`Redis:Configuration`).
- `web` depends on `redis` becoming healthy, so startup waits until Redis responds to `PING`.
- If you change Redis host/port, either update `appsettings.Docker.json` or set env var `Redis__Configuration` on the `web` service.

Troubleshooting
---------------
- If Docker build failed with a test project path error, ensure the app Dockerfile restores/builds only `BlazorAutoApp.csproj` (already set up).
- If HTTPS fails in containers, re-export the dev cert with `docker/create-dev-cert.ps1` and keep the volume mount (`./docker/https:/https:ro`).
- If Seq shows no events:
  - Verify the app container logs show Serilog writing to Seq.
  - Confirm `appsettings.Docker.json` includes the Seq sink with `serverUrl: http://seq:5341`.
  - Ensure the `seq` service is healthy in `docker compose ps` and reachable from the app container.
- If Redis issues occur:
  - Check `redis` health with `docker compose ps` and container logs.
  - Ensure port `6379` isnâ€™t blocked by other processes on your host.
  - Confirm the `web` container sees `Redis:Configuration=redis:6379` (Docker env or appsettings).
